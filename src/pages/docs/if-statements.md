## If

If statements are a way to Block off code behind a Condition.

A typical If statement could look something like this:

```
if (someVar = "a value")
{
    //do something
}
```

## Else

You can also add an Else block, that will be run if the Condition doesn't return true.

```
if (someVar = "a value")
{
    //do something
}
else
{
    //do something else
}
```

If you want you can also chain another If Statement onto it like this:

```
if (someVar = "a value")
{
    //do something
}
else if (someVar = "another value")
{
    //do something else
}
```

## Conditions

Conditions are often used in If Statements, or While Loops, but can also be used outside them.

Valid Operators for conditions are:

| Operator | Condition        |
|----------|------------------|
| =        | Equal            |
| !=       | Not equal        |
| <        | Less than        |
| >        | Greater than     |
| <=       | Less or equal    |
| >=       | Greater or equal |
