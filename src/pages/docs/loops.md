Loops are a way to iterate a block of code.

ReCT has 3 different types of Loops: a For Loop, a From To Loop, and a While Loop.

## While Loop

The While Loop is the simplest loop of all three.

It works in very similar Ways to an If Statement.

Basically, as long as the Condition is true, the code will be iterated.

An example of a While Loop would look like this:

```
while (someVar = "some value")
{
    //hmmmm yes much cod
}
```

## From To Loop

From To Loops are a simpler form of a For Loop.

A From To Loop has a Variable, and a Goal.

(the From To Loop uses the Condition "<="!)

A From To Loop could look like this:

```
from (i <- 0) to 10
{
    //This will be called 11 times
}
```

## For Loops

For Loops in ReCT work basically the same way as they do in C# and Java.

A For Loop always has a Variable, a Condition and an Action.

A For Loop could look like this:

```
for (var i <- 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    //this will be run 10 times
}
```
